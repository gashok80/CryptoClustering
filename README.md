# CryptoClustering
K-Means and PCA
This code applies K-Means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to cluster cryptocurrencies based on performance.

The analysis could be replicable to other financial series, with large amount of data thanks to the use of PCA, which reduces the dimentionality of the data.

The analysis found the same number and composition of clusters (4) when using the original standarized data of 7 series of returns than when using its 3 principal components. These three principal components explained 90% of the variance of the cryptocurrencies' returns.
